# 3D Ball Bouncing Simulation

This project is a 3D ball bouncing simulation implemented using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/). The simulation models the realistic motion of a ball inside a 3D box, incorporating physics elements such as gravity, air resistance, wind, friction, restitution, and collision handling.

## Features
- **Gravity:** Simulates the natural downward force pulling the ball towards the ground.
- **Air Resistance:** Adds drag to the ball's movement, reducing speed over time.
- **Wind Effect:** Applies directional force to the ball, affecting its trajectory.
- **Friction:** Models surface friction when the ball collides with the box walls.
- **Restitution:** Controls the elasticity of collisions, determining how much energy is retained after impact.
- **Collision Handling:** Detects and responds to collisions between the ball and the box walls.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- A compatible C++ compiler (such as GCC or MSVC)
- An IDE like Visual Studio, Xcode, or Code::Blocks

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/adityapatel149/3d-ball-bouncing-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd 3d-ball-bouncing-simulation
   ```
3. Place the project inside the `apps/myApps/` folder of your openFrameworks installation.
4. Open the project in your preferred openFrameworks-compatible IDE.
5. Compile and run the project.

## Usage
- Use the keyboard or mouse (if applicable) to interact with the simulation.
- Observe how different forces affect the motion of the ball within the box.
